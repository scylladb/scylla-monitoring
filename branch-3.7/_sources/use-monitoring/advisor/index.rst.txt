    **The Advisor section**

The Advisor section is located on the Overview dashboard and consists of two parts:
    
On the left, is the Advisor issues table. Each issue has a category, a link to jump to a relevant dashboard, and a description of the issue.

For example, the Advisor could warn about using large cells. Large cells in the data usually indicate a problem with the data model or a problem with the client code, and can impact system performance.
    
On the right, is the system balance section.  This section notifies you about an imbalance between shards or nodes. An imbalanced system may indicate a potential problem.

For example, when a single, hot partition gets most of the requests, making one shard a bottleneck, the balance section will indicate that the latency and cache hits are imbalanced between shards.

Each Advisor issue is explained in detail:

* :doc:`Some queries use ALLOW FILTERING <cqlAllowFiltering>`
* :doc:`Some queries use Consistency Level: ALL <cqlCLAll>`
* :doc:`Some queries use Consistency Level: ANY <cqlCLAny>`
* :doc:`Some queries are not token-aware <cqlNoTokenAware>`
* :doc:`Some SELECT queries are non-paged <cqlNonPaged>`
* :doc:`Some queries are non-prepared <cqlNonPrepared>`
* :doc:`Some queries use reverse order <cqlReverseOrder>`
* :doc:`Some operation failed due to unsatisfied consistency level <nodeCLErrors>`
* :doc:`I/O Errors can indicate a node with a faulty disk <nodeIOErrors>`
* :doc:`Some operations failed on the replica side <nodeLocalErrors>`
* :doc:`CQL queries are not balanced among shards  <nonBalancedcqlTraffic>`

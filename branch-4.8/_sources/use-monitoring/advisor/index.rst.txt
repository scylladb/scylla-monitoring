    **The Advisor section**

The Advisor section is located on the Overview dashboard and holds the Advisor issues table. Each issue has a category, a link to jump to a relevant dashboard, and a description of the issue.

For example, the Advisor could warn about using large cells. Large cells in the data usually indicate a problem with the data model or a problem with the client code, and can impact system performance.
    
Each Advisor issue is explained in detail:

* :doc:`Some queries use ALLOW FILTERING <cqlAllowFiltering>`
* :doc:`Some queries use Consistency Level: ALL <cqlCLAll>`
* :doc:`Some queries use Consistency Level: ANY <cqlCLAny>`
* :doc:`Some queries are not token-aware <cqlNoTokenAware>`
* :doc:`Some SELECT queries are non-paged <cqlNonPaged>`
* :doc:`Some queries are non-prepared <cqlNonPrepared>`
* :doc:`Some operation failed due to unsatisfied consistency level <nodeCLErrors>`
* :doc:`I/O Errors can indicate a node with a faulty disk <nodeIOErrors>`
* :doc:`Some operations failed on the replica side <nodeLocalErrors>`
